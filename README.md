# 🚦 Traffic Accident Prediction System

This comprehensive machine learning pipeline analyzes traffic accident data
to predict injury severity and generate actionable safety insights. 
The system features a complete end-to-end workflow including 
exploratory data analysis (EDA), intelligent data preprocessing, 
focused model training with three core algorithms
(Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest), 
and an interactive Streamlit web application for real-time predictions. 
Built with advanced statistical validation, domain-specific feature engineering, 
and production-ready architecture, the pipeline transforms raw accident 
data into valuable insights through automated preprocessing, comprehensive model 
evaluation with cross-validation, and professional visualizations using Plotly. 
The web interface provides intuitive navigation for both technical and non-technical 
users, enabling dataset exploration, model training, performance evaluation, and 
real-time accident severity prediction with confidence assessment, making it an 
ideal solution for traffic safety analysts, emergency services, and policy makers 
seeking data-driven decision support for improving road safety.
